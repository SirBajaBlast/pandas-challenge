For this assignment, we were given two databases: one detailing each schoolâ€™s size and budget, and the other database containing the reading and math scores for every student at each high school. The goal was to create summaries for the district, each school, and lastly different metrics that may or may not have affected student performance.

To complete the assignment, I used examples from our lessons and the Xpert Learning Assistant.
